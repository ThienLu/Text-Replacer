# Text-Replacer
https://thienlu.github.io/Text-Replacer/

A very simple website that can replace specific text in a much bigger text. Also includes an automatic night mode that switches the background color after a specific time. 

All in all, this is a very simple website that was more of a light refresher and practice to using JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
